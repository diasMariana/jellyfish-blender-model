## Features

- Complete jellyfish design created with geometry nodes.
- Manipulate the length and position of the tentacles using an external object. Specify the object to use in the `Tentacles controller` input attribute, which is accessible in the modifiers tab.
- Control the oscillation speed of different parts of the jellyfish by adjusting parameters such as `Head oscillation speed,` `Internal tentacles oscillation speed,` and `External tentacles oscillation speed.` These parameters are also exposed as input attributes.
